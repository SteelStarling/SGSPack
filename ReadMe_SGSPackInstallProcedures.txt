Install Procedures:
1. Open and run the included Forge 1.12.2 installer
	a. Give the installer your Minecraft directory. It should be in the right place by default, but if you are running a differing install of Minecraft/have changed its install location, tell Forge this.
	b. Press install and open your Minecraft Launcher (if the launcher was open already, please restart it).
	c. Check to see if the Minecraft version the client is attempting to run is Forge 1.12.2, if it is, then the installation has worked properly.
2. Check if you have a mods folder currently in your .minecraft folder, if you do, please remove these mods, as they may break/conflict with the pack.
	a. You can remove these mods by either:
		i. Deleting them from the folder.
		ii. Copying them to a different folder.
		iii. Renaming the folder to something else.
3. Once you no longer have a mods folder/no longer have any mods in your mods folder, please copy the enclosed SGSPack mods folder into your .minecraft folder.
4. Launch Minecraft from the Forge 1.12.2 profile in your launcher.
5. Enjoy.
